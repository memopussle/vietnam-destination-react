### This is an exercise to practice and apply concepts of props, destructuring and map(). 


--- 

#### Props 

- Props are arguments passed into child React components. Props stands for properties

#### Destruturing 

- This is a new features of JavaScript ES6. Write less and more efficient code.

```
const vehicles = ['mustang', 'f-150', 'expedition'];

// old way
const car = vehicles[0];
const truck = vehicles[1];
const suv = vehicles[2];


//new way
const [car, truck, suv] = vehicles;
```
### map()

- This is a method to iterate/ loop through an array. This is also a method to display object array on JSX.
